      title: "Montreal Convention - Rules on Damages & Delays in Air Travel",
      subtitle:
        "Daily, countless goods are transported by air from one place to another. Issues are inevitable. In the context of globalization, uniform international regulations were necessary to clarify liability in case of damage or loss. These regulations were established with the Montreal Convention.",
      text: `What is the Montreal Convention?
      The Montreal Convention, also known as the Montreal Agreement, was signed on May 28, 1999, among many countries. The aim of the convention was to create uniform and modern rules for international air transport. The Montreal Convention replaced the Warsaw Convention in the signatory states.
      
      The Montreal Convention clarifies the liability of airlines in the event of damages occurring during a flight to passengers, baggage, and goods. In case of damages, airlines are generally obligated to pay compensation.
      
      Signatories of the Montreal Convention
      Since its adoption in 1999, over 130 countries have signed the convention, including:
      
      The European Union countries,
      The USA, Canada, Australia, and Japan.
      Most popular vacation destinations like Thailand, Indonesia, and Panama have also joined the convention.
      
      Scope of the Montreal Convention
      The Montreal Convention applies to the carriage of passengers, baggage, and goods for which payment is made. It also applies if the carriage is free of charge, as long as it is conducted by an airline. This means private carriage of persons, baggage, or goods does not fall under the convention.
      
      Transportations between two places within the same country are generally not covered by the Montreal Convention. However, in Europe, Regulation EC 889/2002 specifies that the Montreal Convention also applies to domestic flights within the EU.
      
      Claims under the Montreal Convention
      Different compensation claims arise from the Montreal Convention. Here we focus on compensation claims for:
      
      - Personal injuries
      - Baggage issues
      - Flight delays
      
      Personal injuries
      Accidents can also happen during air travel. If a passenger is injured or dies on board the aircraft or during boarding or disembarking, the airline is liable.
      
      The following liability limits apply to personal injuries:
      
      The "presumed fault" of the airline generally applies. Therefore, the airline is liable to the full extent.
      If the airline can prove it was not at fault, it is liable up to 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).
      A complete exclusion of the airline's liability is only possible if it proves the passenger was responsible for the damage.
      
      Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)
      
      SDRs are an artificial currency unit of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). They are often used in transport law as a conversion unit for damages.
      
      The SDR is composed of the five major currencies: US Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Yen, and Chinese Yuan. It is recalculated daily and is therefore subject to regular fluctuations.
      
      You can find the current exchange rate here: CUEX (external website)
      
      Baggage issues
      According to the Montreal Convention, a claim for compensation exists for baggage damage. Damage to baggage means it is damaged, destroyed, or completely lost.
      
      The following liability limits apply to baggage damage:
      
      The liability limit for loss, destruction, or damage is 1,288 SDRs.
      The liability limit is waived if the passenger can prove the damage was caused by intent or negligence of the airline.
      There is no liability claim against the airline if the baggage was already damaged before the transport or if the damage occurred because the baggage was unsuitable for transport.

      Flight delay compensation
      Delays are common at airports worldwide. Passengers affected by delays miss important appointments or start their long-awaited vacation late. Thanks to the Montreal Convention, passengers have the right to compensation in such cases.
      
      To receive compensation, a specific damage must result from the delay. This means the damage must be quantifiable. This is possible if connecting flights or services such as a cruise were missed. Overtime for employees can also be precisely quantified.
      
      The following liability limits apply to flight delays:
      
      The liability limit is 5,346 SDRs.
      If the passenger can prove intent or negligence by the airline, the limit is waived.
      If the airline can prove it was not at fault for the delay, it can be exempted from liability.
      Note: It is often difficult or impossible to determine the exact damage caused by a flight delay. The EU Passenger Rights Regulation also secures compensation rights for flight delays within the EU. These compensations are lump sums, independent of the actual damage.
      
      Additionally, under the EU regulation, the compensation is paid directly to the passenger, whereas under the Montreal Convention, it is paid to the contract partner. In the case of business trips, companies can claim compensation based on the Montreal Convention, while employees can claim compensation based on the EU regulation.
      
      Was your flight delayed? Check your claims with fine. and secure up to €600 compensation based on the EU Passenger Rights Regulation.
      
      Compensation for delayed baggage
      It's not uncommon for baggage to arrive late at the destination. Besides additional time, it usually means extra costs for travelers. In this case, the airline must compensate for all necessary and reasonable replacement purchases.`,

        "Your Rights to Compensation for Lost or Delayed Baggage",
      subtitle:
        "The joy of travel can quickly vanish if baggage arrives late, is damaged, or is completely lost. This not only means unnecessary time and bureaucracy but also additional costs. In this article, we show you your rights in case of baggage issues on your flight and when you are entitled to compensation.",
      text: `1. Montreal Convention - Legal Basis for Your Compensation Claims
      Your flight rights regarding your luggage are regulated by the Montreal Convention. The convention sets the liability by the airline and the limits for compensation amounts. Over 130 countries have now signed the convention and are committed to its rules.
      
      The convention regulates three different cases regarding baggage, which we will explain in detail.
      
      2. Compensation for delayed baggage
      Standing at the baggage claim, but your suitcase is not there. This is the most common baggage problem many travelers have experienced. The frustrating part: until the baggage arrives (usually with the next flight), onward travel is often impossible. Additionally, clothes and hygiene items are in the suitcase, requiring replacement purchases.
      
      Compensation entitlement for delayed baggage
      The Montreal Convention stipulates that the airline must reimburse all expenses incurred due to the baggage delay. However, these must be necessary and reasonable expenses. An unreasonable expense would be expensive designer clothing.
      
      What to do if your baggage is delayed
      If your baggage is delayed, we recommend the following:
      
      Report to the airline's lost luggage desk as soon as possible to have the staff locate your baggage.
      Keep all receipts for necessary purchases to get the costs reimbursed later by the airline.
      Check with the airline before making expensive purchases to ensure the costs will be covered later.
      3. Compensation for damaged baggage
      Baggage handling at airports often leaves little time, leading to less careful handling of suitcases and backpacks. The result is damage to the suitcase itself or its contents. The destruction of items also counts.
      
      Compensation entitlement for damaged baggage
      For this case, the Montreal Convention grants the traveler a right to compensation. The maximum limit is 1,288 Special Drawing Rights (currently about €1550; learn more about SDRs in our article on the Montreal Convention).
      
      If you can prove that the damage was caused by intent or negligence, there is no maximum limit for compensation. If the airline can prove that the baggage was already damaged or fundamentally unsuitable for transport, it is not liable.
      
      What to do if your baggage is damaged
      If you find damage to your baggage, we recommend the following:
      
      Take photos of the damage to your baggage. If possible, also have pictures of the baggage condition before the flight.
      Report the damage immediately upon arrival to the airline.
      Fill out the damage report and keep a copy for later.
      4. Compensation for lost baggage
      The worst-case scenario occurs if suitcases or other baggage do not arrive at all and are lost. Besides clothes or expensive electronics, items of personal value

 are often in the suitcase.
      
      Compensation entitlement for lost baggage
      If your baggage is lost, the airline must compensate for the lost items up to 1,288 Special Drawing Rights. Prove the value of your belongings. There is no maximum limit if the airline was negligent or caused the loss intentionally.
      
      What to do if your baggage is lost
      If you notice that your baggage is lost, proceed as follows:
      
      Report to the lost luggage desk immediately. Have the employees locate your suitcase.
      Fill out the lost baggage report and get a copy.
      Keep all receipts for the lost items to get the value reimbursed later.
      Follow up regularly with the airline about your baggage status.`

      subtitle:
        "When airlines go bankrupt, it can disrupt travel plans significantly, especially for those who booked package tours. Understanding your rights in such scenarios can help you navigate the situation more effectively.",
      text: `1. Rights under the Package Travel Directive
      If your package tour is affected by the airline’s bankruptcy, you have specific rights under the European Union Package Travel Directive (PTD). The PTD protects travelers who book travel packages that include at least two travel services, such as flights, accommodation, or car rentals.
      
      2. Right to Refund or Alternative Transport
      Under the PTD, if your airline goes bankrupt and it affects your package tour, the tour operator must offer you a refund or alternative transport arrangements. This ensures you can either continue your journey or receive compensation for the disruption.
      
      3. Role of Travel Insurance
      Travel insurance can provide additional protection in case of airline bankruptcy. Depending on the policy, it may cover additional costs incurred due to the bankruptcy, such as rebooking flights or extending accommodation.
      
      4. Seeking Compensation
      If you suffer financial loss due to the airline's bankruptcy, you may seek compensation. Keep all documentation related to your booking and any additional expenses incurred.
      
      5. Contacting Your Tour Operator
      In case of airline bankruptcy, immediately contact your tour operator for assistance. They are required to assist you under the PTD and will provide you with the necessary support to mitigate the disruption.
      
      In conclusion, understanding your rights and taking proactive steps can help you manage the situation effectively when an airline goes bankrupt, ensuring your travel plans are not entirely derailed.`
